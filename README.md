# Neural-Network-Numpy
Python Neural Network implementation from scratch with NumPy package.

May have variable number of hidden fully-connected (fc) layers, variable number of hidden neurons in each fc layer, variable number of activation layers, variable number of activation units in each activation layer (with choice of activation function Sigmoid or ReLu), and softmax layer.

May choose between multi-class classification with cross entropy loss or binary-class classification with binary cross entropy.

Tested by overfitting Neural Network and Logistic Regression models on Sklearn's Breast Cancer dataset and Sklearn's Iris dataset.
